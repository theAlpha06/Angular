STARTUP Process

index.html file is served and the scripts are injected and from there angular knows which files or components to show.
The entry point of Angular is main.ts -> it bootstrap the appmodule -> which in turn says angular to load the appcomponent.

Components

We start our app from the root component i.e. AppComponent and then we nest other components.
AppComponent is the root component which is bootstrap and all the other component will be add to app.component.html.

Creating a component
A component is simply a typescript class so that angular is able to instantiate it, to create objects based on the blue print we set in the ts file.

Angular uses components to build web pages and use modules to basically bundle different pieces into packages.

Template has to be present, we can omit selectors and styles.

We can use square brackets to select attributes, class even.

Everything that return a string can be used in string interpolation {{this should be string or should result into an string}}

[(ngModel)] it will trigger on the input event and update the value of serverName in our component and it will also update the value of the input element if we change serverName somewhere else. This is what two way binding.
